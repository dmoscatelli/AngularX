                            AngularX, or Angular as it's commonly referred, is made up of thinkers that solve complex problems everyday in the name of our core mission: to compile professional standards, liberal arts, and engineering into platforms that are useful to our users, clients, and the world. But what makes Angular truly unique is a workplace culture that encourages innovation and a willingness to fail when experimenting with big ideas </p>

                                Because our mission is so vast in scope, our focus tends to migrate. For now, we are concentrating on the following three issues: Sustainability, profitability, and big data analytics. We see these as pressing matters to organizations, people, and the world. As our understanding changes, so too will our focus.
